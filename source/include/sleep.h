 *
 * The processor is setup ready for sleep, and sent to sleep using __WFI(). In this mode, the
 * system clock to the core is stopped until a reset or an interrupt occurs. This eliminates
 * dynamic power used by the processor, memory systems and buses. The processor, peripheral and
 * memory state are maintained, and the peripherals continue to work and can generate interrupts.
 *
 * The processor can be woken up by any internal peripheral interrupt or external pin interrupt.
 *
 * @note
 *  The mbed interface semihosting is disconnected as part of going to sleep, and can not be restored.
 * Flash re-programming and the USB serial port will remain active, but the mbed program will no longer be
 * able to access the LocalFileSystem

 * The processor can only be woken up by an external interrupt on a pin or a watchdog timer.
